# [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/description/)

## Description

Given a string **s**, find the longest palindromic substring in **s**. You may assume that the maximum length of **s** is 1000.

**Example 1:**

>Input: "babad" <br>
Output: "bab" <br>
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

>Input: "cbbd" <br>
Output: "bb"

## Idea

The key point is to skip the continuous duplicates in statement `center = right + 1`. Suppose we have a continuous duplicates substr bounded by `left` and `right` and denote it as `P`. Then `P` can be considered as a single character and once we have considered the situation that `P` locates the center of palindrome, we can skip it immediately.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string longestPalindrome(string s) {
        int length = s.length();
        if (length <= 1) {
            return s;
        }
        
        int minStart = 0, maxLen = 1;
        
        for (int center = 0; center < length;) {
            if (length - center <= maxLen >> 1) {
                break;
            }
            int left = center, right = center;
            while (right < length - 1 && s[right + 1] == s[right]) {
                ++right;
            }
            center = right + 1;
            while (left > 0 && right < length - 1 && s[right + 1] == s[left - 1]) {
                ++right;
                --left;
            }
            int newLen = right - left + 1;
            if (newLen > maxLen) {
                minStart = left;
                maxLen = newLen;
            }
        }
        
        return s.substr(minStart, maxLen);
    }
};
```
