# [99. Recover Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/description/)

## Description

Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,null,null,2]

   1
  /
 3
  \
   2

Output: [3,1,null,null,2]

   3
  /
 1
  \
   2
```

**Eaxmple 2:**

```
Input: [3,1,4,null,null,2]

  3
 / \
1   4
   /
  2

Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]

  2
 / \
1   4
   /
  3
```

**Follow up:**

- A solution using O(*n*) space is pretty straight forward.
- Could you devise a constant space solution?

## Idea

This is actually an in-order traverse problem. As we all know, the in-order output for BST is ascending order. Since here are only two elements need to be swapped, we can just find them and swap them. We can do an in-order traverse and find the two elements which disobey ascending order. Then swap the value of them, and this problem would be solved.

However, the question has a higher requirement. That is to solve this question with O(*1*) space. As we all know, whether the recursive method or the stack method can't solve this with constant space.

Well, in problem [94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/description/), I have learned a [iterative method](http://blog.leanote.com/post/limit01/94.-Binary-Tree-Inorder-Traversal) without stack, which called morris travese and it only cost constant space! This method can be applied to this problem, too.

## Solution

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode *firstNode = NULL;
    TreeNode *secondNode = NULL;
    TreeNode *prevNode = new TreeNode(INT_MIN);
    
    void verify(TreeNode *root) {
        if (!firstNode && prevNode->val >= root->val) {
            firstNode = prevNode;
        }
        
        if (firstNode && prevNode->val >= root->val) {
            secondNode = root;
        }
        
        prevNode = root;
    }
    
    void recoverTree(TreeNode* root) {
        traverse(root);
        if (!firstNode) return;
        int temp = firstNode->val;
        firstNode->val = secondNode->val;
        secondNode->val = temp;
    }
    
    void traverse(TreeNode *root) {
        /* recursive
        if (!root) return;
        
        traverse(root->left);
        
        if (!firstNode && prevNode->val >= root->val) {
            firstNode = prevNode;
        }
        
        if (firstNode && prevNode->val >= root->val) {
            secondNode = root;
        }
        
        prevNode = root;
        traverse(root->right);
        */
        
        // morris traverse
        if (!root) return;
        TreeNode *cur = root;
        
        while (cur) {
            if (!cur->left) {
                // do something
                verify(cur);
                cur = cur->right;
            }
            else {
                TreeNode *pre = cur->left;
                while (pre->right != NULL && pre->right != cur) {
                    pre = pre->right;
                }
                if (pre->right == cur) {
                    pre->right = NULL;
                    //do something
                    verify(cur);
                    cur = cur->right;
                } else {
                    pre->right = cur;
                    cur = cur->left;
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
