# 57. Insert Interval
---

## Description

Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
**Output:** [[1,5],[6,9]]

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,9]
**Output:** [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
**Explanation:** Because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

## Idea

The idea is very easy. **First**, find the intervals locates at left of the new interval, denote them as *left* and find the intervals locates at right of the new interval, denote them as *right*. **Second**, judge whether the sum of length of *left* and length of *right* equals to the length of the origin intervals; If yes, then the new interval should just be insert to the middle of left and right; If not, then overlaping occurs, we can adjust the new interval to `(start, end)`, in which `start = min(newInterval.start, intervals[len(left)].start)` and `end = max(newInterval.end, intervals[~len(right)].end)`. **Finally**, the result is `left + [Inteval(start, end)] + right`.

## Solution (Python3)

```python
# Definition for an interval.
# class Interval:
#     def __init__(self, s=0, e=0):
#         self.start = s
#         self.end = e

class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals, newInterval):
        """
        :type intervals: List[Interval]
        :type newInterval: Interval
        :rtype: List[Interval]
        """
        start, end = newInterval.start, newInterval.end
        left = [i for i in intervals if i.end < start]
        right = [i for i in intervals if i.start > end]
        if len(left) + len(right) != len(intervals):
            start = min(start, intervals[len(left)].start)
            end = max(end, intervals[~len(right)].end)
        return left + [Interval(start, end)] + right
