# [522. Longest Uncommon Subsequence II](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-ii/description/)

## Description

Given a list of strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence among them. The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be **any** subsequence of the other strings.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.

The input will be a list of strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** "aba", "cdc", "eae"
**Output:** 3

**Note:**

1. All the given strings' lengths will not exceed 10.
2. The length of the given list will be in the range of [2, 50].

## Idea

This problem is very interesting. To solve this problem, let me show a fact that, the longest uncommon subsequence must be the `str` in the `strs` if it exists.

We can prove the fact by contradiction. Suppose the longest uncommon subsequence is not a `str` in the `strs`, but a subsequence `substr` of one of the `str` in the `strs`. Without loss of generality, we say that the `substr` is a **subsequence** of `S`. Since `substr` is the longest uncommon subsequence, then `substr` is only a subsequence of `S` and is not any subsequence of the other strings. Subsequently we can get the fact that `S` is also not any subsequence of the other strings! So clearly `S` is the longest uncommon subsequence instead of `substr`, which contradicts our hypothesis in the beginning.

With this significant fact, we can solve this question easily:

1. First, sort `strs` in length descending order.
2. Second, for a given `str` `S`, check all the other `str` whose length is no shorter than `S`. If find `S` is a subsequence of these `str`, then break; otherwise, we have already found the longest uncommon subsequence.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    static bool comp(const string &s1, const string &s2) {
        return s1.length() > s2.length();
    }
    
    bool isSubsequence(const string &s1, const string &s2) {
        // return (s2 is subsequence of s1)
        if (s1.length() == s2.length()) {
            if (s1 == s2) {
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            size_t i = 0, j = 0;
            while (j < s2.size()) {
                char ch = s2[j];
                while (i < s1.length() && s1[i] != ch) {
                    i++;
                }
                if (i == s1.length()) {
                    return false;
                }
                i++;
                j++;
            }
            return true;
        }
    }

    
    int findLUSlength(vector<string>& strs) {
        // sort strs in length descending order
        sort(strs.begin(), strs.end(), comp);
        // to record whether has common subsequence
        bool hasCommonSubsequence = false;
        int len = -1;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < strs.size(); ++i) {
            len = (int)strs[i].length();
            hasCommonSubsequence = false;
            size_t j = 0;
            for (; j < strs.size() && (int)strs[j].length() >= len; ++j) {
                if (i == j) {
                    continue;
                }
                if (isSubsequence(strs[j], strs[i])) {
                    hasCommonSubsequence = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!hasCommonSubsequence) {
                break;
            }
        }
        // the above for loop can be terminated by either 
        // hasCommonSubsequence == false or i == strs.size(). 
        // The latter case means there is no LUS.
        return hasCommonSubsequence ? -1 : len;
    }
};
