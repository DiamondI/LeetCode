# [114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/description/)

## Description

Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```

The flattened tree should look like:

```
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```

## Idea

We can do the following process to approach the result:

- First, find the last node in the current node's left subtree and denote it as *p*.
- Second, let current node's right subtree to be *p*'s right subtree.
- Third, let current node's left subtree to be current node's right subtree.
- Finally, let current node's left subtree to be null.

Why these procedures work? From the above description, we can find that the flatten order is exactly pre-order. Then the right subtree must appear after the last node of current node's left subtree. And this node is actually the *pre-node* of current node in in-order. Then the skill in [morris traversal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-tree-traversal-without-recursion-and-without-stack/) can be applied to this problem.

## Solution

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
        TreeNode *cur = root;
        while (cur) {
            if (cur->left) {
                TreeNode *tmp = cur->left;
                while (tmp->right) {
                    tmp = tmp->right;
                }
                tmp->right = cur->right;
                cur->right = cur->left;
                cur->left = NULL;
            }
            cur = cur->right;
        }
    }
};
```
