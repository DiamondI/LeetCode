# Description:
Implement a MapSum class with **insert**, and **sum** methods.

For the method insert, you'll be given a pair of (string, integer). 
The string represents the key and the integer represents the value. 
If the key already existed, then the original key-value pair will be overridden to the new one.

For the method sum, you'll be given a string representing the prefix, 
and you need to return the sum of all the pairs' value whose key starts with the prefix.

# Example:
```
Input: insert("apple", 3), Output: Null
Input: sum("ap"), Output: 3
Input: insert("app", 2), Output: Null
Input: sum("ap"), Output: 5
```

# Solution:
```python
class TrieNode():
    def __init__(self, count = 0):
        self.count = count
        self.children = {}
        
class MapSum(object):

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.root = TrieNode()
        self.dict = {}

    def insert(self, key, val):
        """
        :type key: str
        :type val: int
        :rtype: void
        """
        difference = val - self.dict.get(key, 0)
        self.dict[key] = val
        
        cur = self.root
        cur.count += difference
        for char in key:
            if char not in cur.children:
                cur.children[char] = TrieNode()
            cur = cur.children[char]
            cur.count += difference

    def sum(self, prefix):
        """
        :type prefix: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        cur = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in cur.children:
                return 0
            cur = cur.children[char]
        return cur.count
        


# Your MapSum object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MapSum()
# obj.insert(key,val)
# param_2 = obj.sum(prefix)
```

# Explaination:
Use tires and it helps a lot on dealing with prefix. Here's the link to the web 
introducing [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) specificly.  
For **inserting**, if the string is not in the Trie, then we just need add it into the Trie. Otherwise, 
we need to calculate the difference between the previous and new value, then update the nodes with this 
difference when traversing down the nodes in Trie.  
For **sum**, it's very easy since the result is already stored the Trie.
