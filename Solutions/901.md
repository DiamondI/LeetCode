# [901. Online Stock Span](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-101/problems/online-stock-span/)

## Description

Write a class `StockSpanner` which collects daily price quotes for some stock, and returns the *span* of that stock's price for the current day.


The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days **(starting from today and going backwards)** for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.

For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were `[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]`, then the stock spans would be `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]`.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** ["StockSpanner","next","next","next","next","next","next","next"], [[],[100],[80],[60],[70],[60],[75],[85]]<br>
**Output:** [null,1,1,1,2,1,4,6] <br>
**Explanation:** <br>
First, S = StockSpanner() is initialized.  Then:<br>
S.next(100) is called and returns 1,<br>
S.next(80) is called and returns 1, <br>
S.next(60) is called and returns 1, <br>
S.next(70) is called and returns 2, <br>
S.next(60) is called and returns 1, <br>
S.next(75) is called and returns 4, <br>
S.next(85) is called and returns 6.<br>
Note that (for example) S.next(75) returned 4, because the last 4 prices <br>
(including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.

**Note:**

1. Calls to `StockSpanner.next(int price) will have `1 <= price <= 10^5`.
2. There will be at most `10000` calls to `StockSpanner.next` per test case.
3. There will be at most `150000` calls to `StockSpanner.next` across all test cases.
4. The total time limit for this problem has been reduced by 75% for C++, and 50% for all other languages.

## Idea

We can maintain a map to store the start of a consecutive prices from today. For example, in `[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]`, the start of `70` is the first `60`, then for the second `60`, since it's less than `70`, the answer is just `1`. And its start is `70`. Then for `75`, it's greater than `60`, then we can search back from second `60`'s start, which is `70`, until we find a price that is greater than `75`. And the first price greater than `75` is `80`. Then the result length for `75` is `len([60, 70, 60, 75]) = 4`. And the start for `75` is the first `60`.

## Solution

```cpp
class StockSpanner {
public:
    vector<int> prices;
    map<int, int> index2start;
    StockSpanner() {
    }
    
    int next(int price) {
        if (prices.empty()) {
            prices.push_back(price);
            index2start[prices.size() - 1] = prices.size() - 1;
            return 1;
        }
        int lastPrice = prices.back();
        int lastIndex = prices.size() - 1;
        prices.push_back(price);
        if (price < lastPrice) {
            index2start[prices.size() - 1] = prices.size() - 1;
            return 1;
        }
        int i;
        for (i = index2start[lastIndex]; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (prices[i] > price) {
                break;
            }
        }
        index2start[prices.size() - 1] = i + 1;
        return prices.size() - 1 - i;
    }
};
