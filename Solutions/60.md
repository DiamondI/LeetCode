# Description
The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,  
We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

1. "123"
2. "132"
3. "213"
4. "231"
5. "312"
6. "321"

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

**Note**: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

# Idea
We can know where the kth element locates, for eaxmple in n = 4: 1 p{2, 3, 4}, 2 p{1, 3, 4}, 3 p{1, 2, 4} or 4 p{1, 2, 3}. Since for n = 4, there're 24 possible permutations and if k = 13, then it must locate in 3 p{1, 2, 4}. After that, we decrease k by 2 * 6 (6 represents 3!), then k = 1. It must locate in 1 p{2, 4}.And we can repeat this progress to find the actual permutation. That is 3, 1, 2, 4.

# Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def getPermutation(self, n, k):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type k: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        num = 1
        factorial = [1]
        for i in range(n):
            num *= i + 1
            factorial.append(num)

        nums = [i + 1 for i in range(n)]
        k -= 1

        res = ''

        for i in range(n):
            index = k / factorial[n - i - 1]
            res += str(nums[index])
            del nums[index]
            k -= index * factorial[n - i - 1]

        return res
```
