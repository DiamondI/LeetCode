# 63. Unique Paths II
---

## Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

![](https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/robot_maze.png)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

## Idea
We can solve the question by DP. It's quiet obvious that the number of ways from start point to the position (i, j), denote as dp[i][j], equals to dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] if there's no obstacle in position (i, j). Then we have a solution like this:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        """
        :type obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        m = len(obstacleGrid[0])
        n = len(obstacleGrid)
        dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for i in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][1] = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                if not obstacleGrid[i - 1][j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]
        
        return dp[n][m]
```

However, this solution wastes many space for maintaining an *m* x *n* matrix, only using dp[i - 1][j] and dp[i][j - 1]. We can improve the solution, as the following shows:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        """
        :type obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        m = len(obstacleGrid)
        if m == 0:
            return 0
        n = len(obstacleGrid[0])
        dp = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        if obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0:
            dp[1] = 1
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0:
                    dp[j + 1] += dp[j]
                else:
                    dp[j + 1] = 0
        return dp[-1]
```
