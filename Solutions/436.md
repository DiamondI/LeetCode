# Description
Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an interval j whose start 
point is bigger than or equal to the end point of the interval i, which can be called that j is on the "right" of i.

For any interval i, you need to store the minimum interval j's index, which means that the interval 
j has the minimum start point to build the "right" relationship for interval i. If the interval j 
doesn't exist, store -1 for the interval i. Finally, you need output the stored value of each interval as an array.

# Note:

1. You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
2. You may assume none of these intervals have the same start point.

# Example 1:
```
Input: [ [1,2] ]

Output: [-1]

Explanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.
```

# Example 2:
```
Input: [ [3,4], [2,3], [1,2] ]

Output: [-1, 0, 1]

Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point;
For [1,2], the interval [2,3] has minimum-"right" start point.
```

# Solution:
```python
# Definition for an interval.
# class Interval(object):
#     def __init__(self, s=0, e=0):
#         self.start = s
#         self.end = e

class Solution(object):
    def findRightInterval(self, intervals):
        """
        :type intervals: List[Interval]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        left = sorted((ele.start, i) for i, ele in enumerate(intervals))
        ans = []
        for ele in intervals:
            right = bisect.bisect_left(left, (ele.end,))
            ans.append(left[right][1] if right < len(left) else -1)
        return ans
```

# Explaination:
First sort them by the start point and in the meantime, store the information of the **original position**. 
Then noted that for each end point search for the first start point that is equal or higher in a previously 
constructed ordered list of start points. If there exists one, return the index, otherwise, return -1.
