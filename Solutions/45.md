# Jump Game II

## Description:

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

**For example**:

Given array A = ```[2,3,1,1,4]```

The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)

**Note**:
You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

## Solution: (Cpp)

```cpp
#include <cctype>

class Solution {
public:
    int max(const int &left, const int &right) {
        return left > right ? left : right;
    }

    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() < 2)  {
            return 0;
        }

        int currentMax = 0, nextMax = 0, level = 0, i = 0;

        while (currentMax - i + 1 > 0) {
            level++;
            for (; i <= currentMax; ++i) {
                nextMax = max(nextMax, nums[i] + i);
                if (nextMax >= nums.size() - 1) {
                    return level;
                }
            }
            if (currentMax == nextMax) {
                    return INT32_MAX;
            }
            currentMax = nextMax;
        }

        return 0;
    }
};
```

## Idea
The idea is bfs. Divide those numbers into different levels by this method: can be arrived at the first step, at second step, at third step and so on. Subsequently calculate the max index in each level. Once the max index reached the end of the array, the level is the answer.
