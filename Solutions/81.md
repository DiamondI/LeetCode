# [81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/description/)

## Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,0,1,2,2,5,6]` might become `[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
**Output:** false

**Follow up:**

- This is a follow up problem to [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/), where `nums` may contain duplicates.
- Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size();
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int num = nums[mid];
            // found the target
            if (num == target) {
                return true;
            }
            
            if (num > nums[left]) {
                // num > nums[left] means num is on the left of the pivot
                if (target < num && target >= nums[left]) {
                    // num > target >= nums[left] means target and num are both on the left of the pivot
                    // thus target is on the left of num
                    right = mid;
                } else {
                    // otherwise, num is on the left of pivot, but target is on the right of pivot
                    // thus target is on the right of num
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            } else if (num < nums[left]) {
                // num < nums[left] means num is on the right of the pivot
                if (target > num && target <= nums[right - 1]) {
                    // nums[right - 1] >= target > num means target and num are both on the right of the pivot
                    // thus target is on the right of num
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    // otherwise, num is on the right part of pivot, but target is on the left of pivot
                    // thus target is on the left of num
                    right = mid;
                }
            } else {
                // num == nums[left] means duplicates are here
                left++;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
