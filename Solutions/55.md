# 55. Jump Game
## Description

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

## Example
A = ```[2, 3, 1, 1, 4]```, return ```true```.

A = ```[3, 2, 1, 0, 4]```, return ```false```.

## Solution (C)

```c
int max(int a, int b){return a > b ? a : b;}

bool canJump(int* nums, int numsSize) {
    int i = 0;
    for (int reach = 0; i < numsSize && i <= reach; ++i){
        reach = max(reach, nums[i] + i);
    }

    return i == numsSize;
}
```

## Idea
For each turn, calculate the maxReach index, and when the for-loop finishes, if i equals to numsSize, it means that the we can jump to the last index, other wise i equals to maxReach and maxReach doesn't reach the last index.
