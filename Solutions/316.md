# [316. Remove Duplicate Letters](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/description/)

## Description

Given a string which contains only lowercase letters, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appear once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** "bcabc" <br>
**Output:** "abc"

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** "cbacdcbc" <br>
**Output:** "acdb"

## Idea

First, create a char to **last-occur-index** mapping. Then we can maintain a str, denoted as `res`. For every char in `s`, if it's not in `res`, we compare the current char with `res[-1]`, if current char is less than `res[-1]` and its **last-occur-index** is also less than `res[-1]`'s, then we delete `res[-1]` until `res[-1]` doesn't fit this condition. After that, we add current char to `res`.

For example 1: 

The mapping should be: {b:3, c:4:, a:2};
after each iteration, the str `res` should be: b, bc, a, ab, abc.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicateLetters(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        rindex = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(s)}
        result = ''
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c not in result:
                while c < result[-1:] and i < rindex[result[-1]]:
                    result = result[:-1]
                result += c
        return result
```
