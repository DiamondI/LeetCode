# [134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/description/)

## Description

There are *N* gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station *i* is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station *i* to its next station *(i+1)*. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

**Note:**

- If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
- Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
- Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

Output: -1

Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
```

## Idea

It's necessary that the total gas is greater than the total cost to have a solution. But is it sufficient? I think the answer is yes.

We can find the index *i* where the sum of `gas[k] - cost[k]` with k in range of `(0, i)`, including *i*, is minimum. If total gas is greater than total cost, then we can start from the *i + 1*, and that must be a solution to go through the whole curcuit.

Well, let's consider the condition that the minumum value is negative (positive is trivial). Then the sum of `gas[k] - cost[k]` with k in range of `(i + 1, n)` is positive and it is larger since total gas is greater than total cost.

Some friends may ask what if there is a *j* in (i + 1, n) where `sum(i + 1, j)` is negative while the total `sum of (i + 1, n)` is positive? In this case, if start from *i + 1*, it can't go through the whole curcuit because the car will be stuck at the station *j*.

Well, in this case, the minimum sum is not `sum(0, i)` but `sum(0, j)`. And the start index should be *j + 1* instead.

Up to now, I have showed that it's necessary and sufficient that the total gas is greater than the total cost to have a solution.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int total = 0, minimum = INT_MAX, start = 0, n = gas.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            total += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if (total <= minimum) {
                minimum = total;
                start = i + 1;
            }
        }
        // start % n in case start is equal to n
        // and in that case, start should be 0
        return total < 0 ? -1 : start % n;
    }
};
```
