# [583. Delete Operation for Two Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-operation-for-two-strings/description/)

## Description

Given two words *word1* and *word2*, find the minimum number of steps required to make *word1* and *word2* the same, where in each step you can delete one character in either string.

**Example 1:**
>**Input:** "sea", "eat"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".

**Note:**

1. The length of given words won't exceed 500.
2. Characters in given words can only be lower-case letters.

## Idea

It's just an LCS (Longest Continuous Sequence) problem. The answer is `word1.length() + word2.length() - 2 * LCS(word1, word2)`.

If `word1[i] == word2[j]`, then `LCS[i][j] = LCS[i- 1][j - 1] + 1`;
Else `LCS[i][j] = max(LCS[i - 1][j], LCS[i][j - 1])`.

## Solution

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int m = word1.length(), n = word2.length();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
                if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return m + n - 2 * dp[m][n];
    }
};
```

Note that we only need three variables to update `dp[i][j]` here, that means we don't have to maintain the whole matrix. Thus, we can reduce the space complexity from *O(mn)* to *O(m)* or *O(n)*.

### Improve

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int m = word1.length(), n = word2.length();
        vector<int> dp(m + 1, 0);
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            int pre = dp[0];
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
                int tmp = dp[j];
                if (word1[j - 1] == word2[i - 1]) {
                    dp[j] = pre + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[j] = max(dp[j - 1], dp[j]);
                }
                pre = tmp;
            }
        }
        
        return m + n - 2 * dp[m];
    }
};
```
