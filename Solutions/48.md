# Rotate Image

## Description:

You are given an $n \times n$ 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

**Note:**

You have to rotate the image **in-place**, which means you hace to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

**Example 1:**

```
Given input matrix =
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
```

**Example 2**:

```
Given input matrix =
[
  [ 5, 1, 9,11],
  [ 2, 4, 8,10],
  [13, 3, 6, 7],
  [15,14,12,16]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [15,13, 2, 5],
  [14, 3, 4, 1],
  [12, 6, 8, 9],
  [16, 7,10,11]
]
```

## Solution (cpp)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        reverse(matrix.begin(), matrix.end());
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < matrix[i].size(); ++j) {
                swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]);
            }
        }
    }
};
```

## Idea:

Clockwise rotate: first reverse up to down, then swap the symmetry.

Just like this (take the example 1):

```
1 2 3       7 8 9       7 4 1
4 5 6   =>  4 5 6   =>  8 5 2
7 8 9       1 2 3       9 6 3
```
