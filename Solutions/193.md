# 193. Valid Phone Numbers
---
## Description
Given a text file ```file.txt``` that contains list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: **(xxx) xxx-xxxx** or **xxx-xxx-xxxx**. (x means a digit)

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.

For example, assume that ```file.txt``` has the following content:

```
987-123-4567
123 456 7890
(123) 456-7890
```

Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:

```
987-123-4567
(123) 456-7890
```

## Use grep

```bash
grep '^\([0-9]\{3\}-\|([0-9]\{3\}) \)[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{4\}$' file.txt
```

## Explanation
Here ```^``` matches the head of the line and ```$``` matches the tail of the line. ```[0-9]``` matches digits and ```[0-9]\{3\}``` means here exist three digits. Note that ```{``` and ```}``` are special symbols in shell, thus we need ```\``` to escape. Besides, ```\\|``` is used to match the pattern before it or after it.

Then it's clear that the expression ```^\([0-9]\{3\}-\|([0-9]\{3\}) \)``` can match **xxx-** or **(xxx)space**, and ```[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{4\}$``` matches **xxx-xxxx**.
