# [123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/description/)

## Description

Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most *two* transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## Idea

This is a problem which can be solved with high efficiency using dp.

We have two kinds of operations, buy in and sell out. We have at most two transations, that is we have four states, `one buy, one buy one sell, two buys one sell and two buys two sells`. The final result is the maximum of `one buy one sell` and `two buys two sells`.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        if (n <= 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        // trans[0] - one buy; trans[1] - one buy one sell; trans[2] - two buys one sell; trans[3] - two buys two sells
        int trans[4] = {INT_MIN, 0, INT_MIN, 0};
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            trans[0] = max(trans[0], -prices[i]);
            trans[1] = max(trans[1], trans[0] + prices[i]);
            trans[2] = max(trans[2], trans[1] - prices[i]);
            trans[3] = max(trans[3], trans[2] + prices[i]);
        }
        return max(trans[1], trans[3]);
    }
};
```
