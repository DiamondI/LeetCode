# [177. Nth Highest Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/nth-highest-salary/description/)

## Description

Write a SQL query to get the n<sup>th</sup> highest salary from the `Employee` table.

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the n<sup>th</sup> highest salary where n = 2 is `200`. If there is no n<sup>th</sup> highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

```
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
```

## Idea

The idea is the same as [176. Second Highest Salary](http://leanote.com/blog/post/5aed0d33ab6441462f001098)

## Solution

```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
SET N = N - 1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT
        (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
        FROM Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT N, 1)
  );
END
```
