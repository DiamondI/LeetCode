# [900. RLE Iterator](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-101/problems/rle-iterator/)

## Description

Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator is initialized by `RLEIterator(int[] A)`, where `A` is a run-length encoding of some sequence.  More specifically, for all even `i`, `A[i]` tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value `A[i+1]` is repeated in the sequence.

The iterator supports one function: `next(int n)`, which exhausts the next `n` elements `(n >= 1)` and returns the last element exhausted in this way.  If there is no element left to exhaust, `next` returns `-1` instead.

For example, we start with `A = [3,8,0,9,2,5]`, which is a run-length encoding of the sequence `[8,8,8,5,5]`.  This is because the sequence can be read as "three eights, zero nines, two fives".

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** ["RLEIterator","next","next","next","next"], [[[3,8,0,9,2,5]],[2],[1],[1],[2]] <br>
**Output:** [null,8,8,5,-1] <br>
**Explanation:** <br>
RLEIterator is initialized with RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5]). <br>
This maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5]. <br>
RLEIterator.next is then called 4 times: <br>
.next(2) exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5]. <br>
.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [5, 5]. <br>
.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5.  The remaining sequence is now [5]. <br>
.next(2) exhausts 2 terms, returning -1.  This is because the first term exhausted was 5, <br>
but the second term did not exist.  Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.

**Note:**

1. `0 <= A.length <= 1000`
2. `A.length` is an even integer.
3. `0 <= A[i] <= 10^9`
4. There are at most `1000` calls to `RLEIterator.next(int n)` per test case.
5. Each call to `RLEIterator.next(int n)` will have `1 <= n <= 10^9`.

## Idea

`lower_bound` can solve this problem. Don't generate the run-length encoding of the sequence directly and it will cost many time.

## Solution

```cpp
class RLEIterator {
public:
    long long length;
    long long index;
    vector<long long> sequence;
    vector<int> ele;
    RLEIterator(vector<int> A) {
        long long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); ++i) {
            if (i & 1) {
                ele.push_back(A[i]);
                continue;
            }
            sequence.push_back(sum + A[i]);
            sum += A[i];
        }
        length = sum;
        index = 0;
    }
    
    int next(int n) {
        index += n;
        if (index >= length) {
            return -1;
        }
        auto lower = lower_bound(sequence.begin(), sequence.end(), index);
        return ele[lower - sequence.begin()];
    }
};
