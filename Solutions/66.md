# Description:

Given a non-negative integer represented as a non-empty array of digits, plus one to the integer.
You may assume the integer do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

# Ideas:

The **first** idea is to add one using vertical calculation like this:

```
1 1 1
    1
     +
======
1 1 2
```

By this method, we just need to be careful about the carry bits.

But, in python, I'm more likely to change the form of those digits to a normal integer. And that's the **second** idea I come 
up with. Also, my final solution depends on this idea.

# Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits):
        """
        :type digits: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        numstr = ''.join([str(i) for i in digits])
        resstr = str(int(numstr) + 1)
        return [int(i) for i in resstr]
```
