# [135. Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/description/)

## Description

There are `N` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
-   Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** [1,0,2] <br>
**Output:** 5 <br>
**Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** [1,2,2] <br>
**Output:** 4 <br>
**Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

## Idea

We can scan from left2right first and scan right2left. First assgin 1 to each element. Then traverse the array from left-to-right and whenever the current element's ratings is larger than the left neighbour we update the current element's candies in the left2right array as `left2right[i] = left2right[i - 1] + 1`, since the current element's candies are always less than or equal candies than its left neighbour before updation. And we do this for right2left array, too. After that, the result is `sum([max(left2right[i], right2left[i]) for i in range(len(ratings))])`.

## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def candy(self, ratings):
        """
        :type ratings: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(ratings)
        if not n:
            return 0
        
        left2right = [1] * n
        right2left = [1] * n
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                left2right[i] = left2right[i - 1] + 1
                
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
                right2left[i] = right2left[i + 1] + 1
                
        return sum([max(left2right[i], right2left[i]) for i in range(n)])
```

And we can reduce the two array to just one array:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def candy(self, ratings):
        """
        :type ratings: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(ratings)
        if not n:
            return 0
        
        left2right = [1] * n
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                left2right[i] = left2right[i - 1] + 1
        
        res = left2right[-1]
        
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
                left2right[i] = max(left2right[i], left2right[i + 1] + 1)
            res += left2right[i]
                
        return res
```
