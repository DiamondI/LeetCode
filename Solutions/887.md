# [887. Projection Area of 3D Shapes](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-96/problems/projection-area-of-3d-shapes/)

## Description

On a `N * N` grid, we place some `1 * 1 * 1` cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.

Each value `v = grid[i][j]` represents a tower of `v` cubes placed on top of grid cell `(i, j)`.

Now we view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.

A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3 dimensional figure to a 2 dimensional plane. 

Here, we are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return the total area of all three projections.

**Example 1:**


>**Input:** [[2]] <br>
**Output:** 5 <br>

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** [[1,2],[3,4]] <br>
**Output:** 17 <br>
Explanation: <br>
Here are the three projections ("shadows") of the shape made with each axis-aligned plane. <br>

**Example 3**

>**Input:** [[1,0],[0,2]] <br>
**Output:** 8

**Example 4:**

>**Input:** [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]] <br>
**Output:** 14

**Example 5:**

>**Input:** [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]] <br>
**Output:** 21

**Note:**

- `1 <= grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50`

## Idea

Calculate the areas of the three projections and add them together.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int projectionArea(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int xy = 0, xz = 0, yz = 0;
        int n = grid.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int max_height_for_xz = 0, max_height_for_yz = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                xy += (grid[i][j] > 0);
                max_height_for_xz = max(max_height_for_xz, grid[j][i]);
                max_height_for_yz = max(max_height_for_yz, grid[i][j]);
            }
            xz += max_height_for_xz;
            yz += max_height_for_yz;
        }
        return xy + xz + yz;
    }
};
```
