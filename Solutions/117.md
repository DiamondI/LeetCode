# [117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/description/)

## Description

Given a binary tree

```
struct TreeLinkNode {
  TreeLinkNode *left;
  TreeLinkNode *right;
  TreeLinkNode *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.


**Note:**

- You may only use constant extra space.
- Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

**Example:**

Given the following binary tree,

```
     1
   /  \
  2    3
 / \    \
4   5    7
```

After calling your function, the tree should look like:

```
     1 -> NULL
   /  \
  2 -> 3 -> NULL
 / \    \
4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
```
## Idea

It's a bfs problem.

## Solution

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for binary tree with next pointer.
 * struct TreeLinkNode {
 *  int val;
 *  TreeLinkNode *left, *right, *next;
 *  TreeLinkNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void connect(TreeLinkNode *root) {
        TreeLinkNode *cur, *head, *tail;
        cur = root;
        head = tail = NULL;
        while (cur) {
            if (cur->left) {
                if (tail) {
                    tail->next = cur->left;
                    tail = tail->next;
                } else {
                    tail = cur->left;
                    head = cur->left;
                }
            }
            if (cur->right) {
                if (tail) {
                    tail->next = cur->right;
                    tail = tail->next;
                } else {
                    tail = cur->right;
                    head = cur->right;
                }
            }
            cur = cur->next;
            if (!cur) {
                cur = head;
                head = tail = NULL;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
