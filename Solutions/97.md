# [97. Interleaving String](https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/description/)

## Description

Given *s1*, *s2*, *s3*, find whether *s3* is formed by the interleaving of *s1* and *s2*.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac" <br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc" <br>
**Output:** false

## Idea

We can solve this problem by dp. 

DP table represents if *s3* is interleaving at (i+j)th position when *s1* is at ith position, and *s2* is at jth position. 0th position means empty string.

If *s1*, *s2* and *s3* are all empty, then obviously we should return true. If only *s1* is empty, then if previous *s2* position is interleaving and char at current position in *s2* is equal to the char at current position in *s3*, it's considered as interleaving. So as the situation that only *s2* is empty. When both *s1* and *s2* are not empty, then if we arrive (i, j) from (i - 1, j), it's true when (i - 1, j) is interleaving and (i+j)th position in *s3* is equal to i-th position in *s1*; if we arrive (i, j) from (i, j - 1), it's true when (i, j - 1) is interleaving and (i+j)th position in *s3* is equal to j-th position in *s2*.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isInterleave(string s1, string s2, string s3) {
        if (s1.length() + s2.length() != s3.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        bool dp[s1.length() + 1][s2.length() + 1];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length() + 1; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < s2.length() + 1; ++j) {
                if (i == 0 && j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1;
                } else if (i == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j - 1] && s2[j - 1] == s3[i + j - 1]);
                } else if (j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] && s1[i - 1] == s3[i + j - 1]);
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] && s1[i - 1] == s3[i + j - 1]) || (dp[i][j - 1] && s2[j - 1] == s3[i + j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[s1.length()][s2.length()];
    }
};
