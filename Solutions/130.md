# [130. Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/description/)

## Description

Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'` (**the letter O**), capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`.

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example:**

```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```

After running your function, the board should be:

```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

**Explanation:**

Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any `'O'` on the border of the board are not flipped to `'X'`. Any `'O'` that is not on the border and it is not connected to an `'O'` on the border will be flipped to `'X'`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

## Idea

First find those `'O'`s which can't be flipped into `'X'`, and change them to a third character, for example `'1'`. Then flip the remaining `'O'`s in to `'X'`. Finally change the `'1'`s into `'O'`.

Which `'O'`s can't be flipped into `'X'`? Actually, those `'O'`s who are connected to the `'O'` **on the boarder** (including the `'O'` on the boarder) can't flipped into `'X'`.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void check(vector<vector<char>> &board, int m, int n) {
        if (m < 0 || m >= board.size() || n < 0 || n >= board[0].size()) {
            return;
        }
        if (board[m][n] != 'O') {
            return;
        }
        board[m][n] = '1';
        check(board, m + 1, n);
        check(board, m - 1, n);
        check(board, m, n + 1);
        check(board, m, n - 1);
    }
    
    void O2X(vector<vector<char>> &board) {
        for (int i = 0; i < (int) board.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < (int) board[0].size(); ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'O') {
                    board[i][j] = 'X';
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    void one2O(vector<vector<char>> &board) {
        for (int i = 0; i < (int) board.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < (int) board[0].size(); ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == '1') {
                    board[i][j] = 'O';
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    void solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        if (board.size() <= 0) {
            return;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < (int) board.size(); ++i) {
            check(board, i, 0);
            check(board, i, board[0].size() - 1);
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < (int) board[0].size(); ++j) {
            check(board, 0, j);
            check(board, board.size() - 1, j);
        }
        O2X(board);
        one2O(board);
    }
};
```
