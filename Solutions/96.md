# [96. Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/description/)

## Description

Given *n*, how many structurally unique **BST's** (binary search trees) that store values *1* ... *n*?

**Example:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

## Idea

Denote G(n) as the number of BSTs with n nodes.

Then we have the following two equations.

G(n) = F(1, n) + F(2, n) + ... + F(n, n). Wher F(i, n) represents the number of unique BSTs with the root i.

F(i, n) = G(i-1) * G(n-i)	where 1 <= i <= n 

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j]
        
        return dp[n]
```
