# 62. Unique Paths
---

## Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:

>**Input:** m = 3, n = 2
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** m = 7, n = 3
**Output:** 28

## Idea

It's a simple math problem. The answer is just Combination(m + n - 2, min(m, n) - 1).

**m + n - 2** is the total steps from the start point to the finish point. And from the total steps select **min(m, n) - 1** steps to move down or right, then we can get the result.

## Solution

### Python

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        b = min(m, n)
        total = m + n - 2
        x, y = 1, 1
        for i in range(1, b):
            x *= total
            total -= 1
            y *= i
        
        return x / y
```
