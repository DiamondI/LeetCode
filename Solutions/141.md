# [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/)

## Description

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

Follow up:

Can you solve it without using extra space?

## Idea

We can use two pointer to solve this problem. One pointer moves one step every time while the other pointer moves two steps every time. When they meet, we are sure there's a cycle.

## Solution

### C++

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        auto one = head, two = head;
        while (two && two->next) {
            one = one->next;
            two = two->next->next;
            if (one == two) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
