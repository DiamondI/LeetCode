# [884. Decoded String at Index](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-96/problems/decoded-string-at-index/)

## Description

An encoded string `S` is given.  To find and write the decoded string to a tape, the encoded string is read `one character at a time` and the following steps are taken:

- If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
- If the character read is a digit (say `d`), the entire current tape is repeatedly written `d-1` more times in total.

Now for some encoded string `S`, and an index `K`, find and return the `K`-th letter (1 indexed) in the decoded string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "leet2code3", K = 10
Output: "o"
Explanation: 
The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode".
The 10th letter in the string is "o".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "ha22", K = 5
Output: "h"
Explanation: 
The decoded string is "hahahaha".  The 5th letter is "h".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: S = "a2345678999999999999999", K = 1
Output: "a"
Explanation: 
The decoded string is "a" repeated 8301530446056247680 times.  The 1st letter is "a".
```

**Note:**

1. `2 <= S.length <= 100`
2. `S` will only contain lowercase letters and digits `2` through `9`.
3. `S` starts with a letter.
4. `1 <= K <= 10^9`
5. The decoded string is guaranteed to have less than `2^63` letters.

## Idea

Do not try to store the decoded string since it will cause MLE. We can find what the `K`-th character is without generate the decoded string.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isDigit(char c) {
        return c >= '0' && c <= '9';
    }
    string decodeAtIndex(string S, int K) {
        long long N = 0, i = 0;
        for (i; N < K; ++i) {
            N = isDigit(S[i]) ? N * (S[i] - '0') : N + 1;
        }
        
        while (i--) {
            if (isDigit(S[i])) {
                N /= S[i] - '0';
                K %= N;
            } else if (K % N -- == 0) {
                return string(1, S[i]);
            }
        }
    }
};
```
