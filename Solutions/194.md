# 194. Transpose File

---
## Description

Given a text file `file.txt`, transpose its content.

ou may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by the `' '` character.

For example, if `file.txt` has the following content:

```
name age
alice 21
ryan 30
```
Output should be:
```
name alice ryan
age 21 30
```

## Use bash

```bash
awk '
{
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; ++i) {
        if (NR == 1) {
            s[i] = $i;
        } else {
            s[i] = s[i] " " $i;
        }
    }
}
END {
    for (i = 1; s[i] != ""; ++i) {
        print s[i];
    }
}
' file.txt
```

## Explanation
[awk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) is a programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It is a standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems.

Here the `NR` and the `NF` are the special variables in awk. `NR`: "number of the reords", the current line number; `NF`: "number of the fields", the word count in current line.
