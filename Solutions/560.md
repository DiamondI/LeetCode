# Description
Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

# Example:
```
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explaination: only the first two and the last two '1's meet the requirement.
```

# Solution:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def subarraySum(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        counter = collections.Counter()
        counter[0] = 1
        res = summ = 0
        for num in nums:
            summ += num
            res += counter[summ - k]
            counter[summ] += 1
        return res
```

# Explaination:
Let's denote counter[v] as the value of previous prefix sums with value *v*. 
If the current prefix sum has value *w* such that *w* - *v* = *k*, then we 
**add** counter[v] to our result. Because at this time, **nums[0] + nums[1] + ...
\+ nums[t] = w**, and there're **counter[v]** indices i such that **nums[0] + ... + nums[i] 
= v**. Thus, there're **counter[v]** subarrays **nums[i + 1] + ... + nums[t - 1] = k**.
