# [65. Valid Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-number/description/)
---

## Description:

Validate if a given string is numeric.

Some examples:

`"0"` => `true`
`" 0.1 "` => `true`
`"abc"` => `false`
`"1 a"` => `false`
`"2e10"` => `true`

## Idea

No idea, this problem is just a waste of time. Without a clear definition of what is numeric, we can only pass this problem by myriad times of trial and error. That's definitely the **worst** problem I have seen in leetcode!

## Solution

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def isNumber(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        
        try:
            float(s)
            return True
        except:
            return False
```
