# [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/)

## Description

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** 11 <br>
**Output:** 3 <br>
**Explanation:** Integer 11 has binary representation **00000000000000000000000000001011** 

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** 128 <br>
**Output:** 1 <br>
**Explanation:** Integer 128 has binary representation **00000000000000000000000010000000**

## Idea

This problem is very easy.

## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        """
        tmp = n
        res = 0
        while tmp > 0:
            if tmp & 1:
                res += 1
            tmp >>= 1
        return res
        """
        return bin(n).count('1')

```

## Explanation

The code in the comments is a general solution and `bin(n).count('1')` is a solution with python skills. Note that the latter performance may not be so good.
