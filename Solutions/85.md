# [85. Maximal Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/description/)

## Description

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

**Example :**

```
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```

## Idea

We can solve this problem based on the idea of [problem 84: Largest Rectangle in Histogram](http://leanote.com/blog/post/5b174ba2ab644162a6000916).

Suppose there're `m` rows, `n` cols. Then the solution to this problem is the max solution to `m` ***Largest Rectangle in Histogram*** questions. For each cell with `value='1'`, we look upward (north), the number of continuous `'1'` is the height of cell. Thus, we can consider every matrix[0] ~ matrix[row] as a ***Largest Rectangle in Histogram*** problem and thus we have `m` such questions.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int largestRectangleArea(vector<int> &heights) {
        int res = 0;
        stack<int> index;
        vector<int> tmp(heights);
        tmp.push_back(0);
        for (int i = 0; i < (int) tmp.size(); ++i) {
            while (index.size() > 0 && tmp[index.top()] >= tmp[i]) {
                int h = tmp[index.top()];
                index.pop();
                int start = index.size() > 0 ? index.top() : -1;
                res = max(res, h * (i - start - 1));
            }
            index.push(i);
        }
        return res;
    }

    int maximalRectangle(vector<vector<char>> &matrix) {
        if (matrix.size() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int row = matrix.size(), col = matrix[0].size();
        vector<int> heights(col, 0);
        int res = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < row; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; ++j) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == '0') {
                    heights[j] = 0;
                } else {
                    heights[j]++;
                }
            }
            int area = largestRectangleArea(heights);
            res = max(res, area);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
