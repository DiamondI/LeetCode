# [71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/description/)
---

## Description

Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.

For example,
**path** = `"/home/"`, => `"/home"`
**path** = `"/a/./b/../../c/"`, => `"/c"`

**Corner Cases:**

- Did you consider the case where **path** = `"/../"`?
In this case, you should return `"/"`.
- Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes `'/'` together, such as `"/home//foo/"`.
In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return `"/home/foo"`.

## Idea

We can deal with this problem with stack. Consider an element as the content between two slashes. Then if the element is `"."`, just continue; if the element is `".."` and at the same time, the stack is not empty, we have to pop up an element; else if the element is not `".."`, we need to push the element to the stack.

## Solution

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string simplifyPath(string path) {
        string res, tmp;
        vector<string> stk;
        stringstream ss(path);
        while (getline(ss, tmp, '/')) {
            if (tmp == "" || tmp == ".") continue;
            if (tmp == ".." && !stk.empty()) stk.pop_back();
            else if (tmp != "..") stk.push_back(tmp);
        }
        for (auto i: stk) res += "/" + i;
        return res.empty() ? "/" : res;
    }
};
```
