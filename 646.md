# Description:
You are given n pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.

Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.

Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.

# Example:
```
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest chain is [1,2] -> [3,4]
```

# Solution:
```
class Solution(object):
    def findLongestChain(self, pairs):
        """
        :type pairs: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        cur, ans = float('-inf'), 0
        for i in sorted(pairs, key = lambda x : x[1]):
            if cur < i[0]: cur, ans = i[1], ans + 1
        return ans
```

# Explaination:

Just the same as the interval scheduling problem in book *Algprithm Desgin*
